# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-ANN
This project focuses on predicting crop yield using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by leveraging key climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature. It combines machine learning, deep learning (RNN/LSTM), and data visualization to forecast agricultural productivity and assist in data-driven decision-making for farmers and policymakers.
